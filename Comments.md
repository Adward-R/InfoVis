##Background

In the roughly twenty years that Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos, it has produced remarkable profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship.

In January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.

It is January 21, 2014, and as an expert in visual analytics, you are called in to help law enforcement from Kronos and Tethys assess the situation and figure out where the missing employees are and how to get them home again. Time is of the essence.

##Issue Description
1. ###Analyzes the organization structure of 
	- Visualizes the provided relevant data set;
    - Finds the leader(s) of POK;
    - Explores POK’ s spreading in GAStech and grab its network structure;
    - Get to know the structure of the organization as well as its evolution in history;
    - Try to figure out the potential connection between GAStech and POK.


	
	>These are the extraction and integration process upon provided information. The abstracted steps mainly involves thorough analysis on historical documents, report articles and e-mail exchanging contents. We should apply methods to extract those sentences contains important key words, such as POK and GAStech from the files, then filter them to obtain information that is probably useful for us to solve the case.
     We will need to make a intuitionistic chart or diagram on it so that the perplexed clues and logical links among the ocean of data might be caught by our eyes, and then be able to processed by our human mind to obtain a possible version of truth. On the basis of mail sketches, interpersonal relationship diagram which is abstracted from GAStech’ s staff organization, resumes , and also, trace of crucial characters’ actions from other documents which is correlated to this incident, data and its visualization will enable our group members to filter out those GAStech employees who have the closest relation with POK.
     

2. ###Describes the brief condition of the activity that GAStech held during 2014.1.20 and 1.21, while specifying its detailed schedule.

     
	>The distilling and filtering of information. What we need is to figure out what was happening 
before the activity in GAStech from lists of e-mails and news reports, and further more, dispose those details that clearly have something to do with the event.

3. ###Tries to reason the missing of two GAStech employees and provides pertinent evidences.


	
    >The disposal and deducing based on solid data. The official has almost regarded this as kidnapping, thus filtering out those tend to step closer to POK among GAStech employees is urgent and significant; this could be reached by parsing resume informations, while taking into account the result obtained by solving problem section 1 (probable POK lurkers inside GAStech) and 2 (a social relationship chart). Once the parsing consequence confirmed, clustering methods could be applied to collect the common recognizable features of missing staff (and lurkers, maybe) to make the way to a reasonable vanishing cause.
     

##Data Analysis
###1) E-Mails
 - ####Background
     Contents of e-mail exchanging during 2014.01.06 and 2014.01.17;
